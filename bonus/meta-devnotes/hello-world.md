## [1/reset]({%include url.html%}/1-reset)
- Rudy does the honors of triggering the next reset. The program executes and self-destructs. Nothing seems to have changed.
- However, seems like Rudy's been able to alter the world all along?????
- \[Author's note: This was something of a "pilot episode," something scribbled out in MSPaint and not strictly intended to be The Official Starting Point™—but like, it *worked* as one, so it stuck.
- The most significant world-change implication is that the void is *much* more interactive/malleable than previously apparent.]

## [2/debug]({%include url.html%}/2-debug)
- Kade attempts to fill out the world but stress gnaws eternally. Meanwhile, Rudy shows Cyrus around an immersive game; Val crashing in suggests the engrossment is surprisingly literal.
- Although Rudy manages to convince Kade to take a load off and play, "bugs" (jittery graphical errors bearing loose resemblance to lepidopterans) linger throughout. When the group reaches a carefully-carved structure, Kade reveals it's a maze and sculpture she made for Rudy—as a parting gift, when Kade was leaving for college. It was never finished.
- Rudy is irked; he didn't want a grand gesture, he wanted Kade *there*. As their argument escalates the structures crumble. In the midst of the swarm, when Rudy accuses Kade of not caring, Kade nearly succumbs to being too tired to bother. However, vivid imagery of imminent death quickly convinces Kade otherwise.
- As the glitchy dust clears, Rudy remains distant. Kade can't bring herself to make uncertain promises again; too many apologies, she's convinced, not enough action. Still, the admission alone gets Rudy's attention, and they ultimately work to rebuild the blocky game town together.
- There's just one problem, on the way out: returning to base, the four discover that the bus (which Val crashed in earlier, pursuing a bug) ran over the save point. Rudy decides to force-quit by zapping them all with his trusty club-wand-weapon-thing—but only Cyrus and Val "wake up."

-Excuse me, I was doing *something* that time, you know. (panel: KC baffled by the new world)
-yeah, making all these weird-ass robo-clones that literally no one asked for. (panel: Val introducing the bots)

-And so, after much soul-searching and glitch-fixing, we’ve arrived where we are today!
-…right, and i am *not* going to argue that, because we’ve all learned… very important… life lessons….
-Not that anything is that simple. After all, the whole point of a life lesson is that it necessitates awareness and communica—
