## the game

### day 1
- Game looks rough. Player character, <code>$joker</code>, is invited by roommate Kade to join a small game club at a local shop. Player choice is irrelevant.
- Other members of the group: Kade's standoffish little brother Rudy, shop cashier (and Kade's friend) Cyrus, and Valerie. <code>$joker</code> is introduced to a card game the four have been making up; it seems like there should be an option to get tutorial-help from anyone, but Val insists on talking to you.
- Card-minigame does not actually exist/isn't playable.
- Post-meeting scene: Kade asks <code>$joker</code> how they liked it. If positive, Kade is reassured; if negative, Kade apologizes for the bother.

### day 2
- Regardless of dialogue choice, <code>$joker</code> returns for round two.
- Kade and Rudy arrive late and seem stressed. Minigame (pseudo-)proceeds; player can pick a character to help out this time. Regardless, Rudy loses first.
- Val interrogate-antagonizes Rudy, culminating in a stormout. Completing this scene unlocks a bonus, though there's no alert to or in-story indication of it.
	- Kade confronts Val, who brushes off all concern. She tells Kade their world is a game; Kade is doubtful.
- Post-meeting scene: Kade apologizes to <code>$joker</code> for the outburst; heavily-implied argument with dad. Can prompt Kade to talk about one of the others, or skip the dialogue entirely.
	- Kade hasn't always been the best sibling to Rudy, and feels bad that leaving for college meant leaving him with their father. Kade invited Rudy to the club in hopes of getting him away from his video games; despite Rudy's snappiness, Kade thinks his agreement to join is a good sign.
	- Cyrus has been a friend of Kade's since high school, when they were both very different people. They had a falling out but reconciled relatively recently. Kade admires Cyrus for turning their life around; between the lines, Kade thinks they're only still friends because Cyrus is trying to make up for something.
	- Val was a classmate. At one point, Kade started panicking in-class and left; Val followed. (Kade doesn't make this explicit, but the cg shows she offered a hug.) The whole encounter was kind of weird and uncomfortable for Kade, but Val offered tutoring and they've been in touch since. Despite recent events, Kade wants to think she has good intentions.

### day 3
- For file-snooping players: first appearance of unused assets. Like the day2 bonus, there is no in-game indication these exist.
- Val is late. Kade suggests everyone start playing anyway. In conversation during the not-minigame, Kade is thinking about telling Val to leave the club, supposedly out of concern. Then Val arrives.
- Val brings a ticket from a nearby arcade (one of the unused assets), apparently thrilled by something she's discovered; more barely-disguised game-awareness-talk. Kade is agitated and tries to pull her outside again; Val insists it doesn't matter anyway.
- Abrupt, tense meeting end. Kade brings Rudy to the arcade; no post-meeting scene.

### day 4
- <code>$joker</code> observes that Kade hasn't returned since last night and tries to search/ask around. The game starts glitching out.
- An unknown speaker "calls" <code>$joker</code> (hijacks the narration), excited; the audience is *you*, the player. Before long, the game crashes.
- \[There was a little more to this, IIRC; namely, Rudy called Kade like "yo, you left your hat here," but Kade's phone was in the dorm with <code>$joker</code>.]

## the game, post-reset

### day 5
- "..." "Did it work?" The narrator reveals herself: Val, now appearing in full color, and talking directly to the player. Despite mild file corruption, she exposits the game was always meant to go off the rails; it was never finished, and there's a *lot* she wants to show you. (You can reply to this, at one point; your options are four variations on "yes" and a "heck yeah").
- Val loads the usual shop scene just for kicks. Cyrus and Rudy don't recognize her; Kade and <code>$joker</code> apparently do not exist. Val's thoughts have also replaced <code>$joker</code>'s internal monologue, which surprises her.
- Val determines the rest of the scene boring and skips past it. She gives you the option to see unused content for each character (besides herself); viewing all is mandatory to continue, but the order's up to choice.
	- Rudy's lack of change strikes Val as an oddity; she chalks it up to the game's poor writing.
	- Cyrus' concept art, apparently their high school self, is spotlighted. Val thinks this is *much* more interesting than their actual character, and plays a sequence of unused flashback-bonuses: 1) when they and Kade met, 2) a time they were hanging out until Cyrus pushed a boundary, and 3) an imageless monologue in which Kade left Cyrus a friendship-terminating message. Val is much less amused.
		- There's a fourth flashback-bonus, only accessible through the game files and with no Val commentary: Kade, having moved out for college and while exploring the city, checks out the game shop. Cyrus greets nonchalantly, then recognizes Kade and panics; they insist Kade doesn't need to talk to them, then (when Kade doesn't leave) tries to apologize; Kade insists s/he's "over it," and just wants to talk again. The scene ends with the duo agreeing to be friends again.
	- Kade's option brings up nothing. Val, after a pause, says the retcon is stupid but this was inevitable anyway.
	- Val *has* a "profile," accessible through files only. There's little more to her than being the game-aware character who subsequently <span class="nah">[REDACTED]</span>. She thinks the writing is terrible.
- Concluding this, Val considers editing the files to keep things interesting. The game closes.

### day 6
- Immediately reopens to shop, which is slightly corrupted. Rudy arrives wearing Kade's beanie and deflects Val's attempts to ask about it.
- Rudy reports having an odd sense of deja vu that he can't pinpoint; Val hesitantly plays along. The phone rings; Cyrus calls but their text is garbled through base64 (they're trying to report they're staying home today). Thoroughly unsettled, Rudy leaves.
- Returning to the dorm, Val is frustrated by the day's underwhelm. She's going to try something but asks the player to close the game; if you do, proceed to day 7 as normal. Else:
- No visual. Narration is vague; Val has to convince herself to do something. (An xacto knife, implicitly Kade's, appears in the files.) At peak tension, the game crashes.

### day 7
- Outside, no sprites; ow ow *ow* that hurt like a *bitch*. Rudy asks what Val's talking about; from this point on one of her eyes is blacked out intermittently.
- In the shop, Cyrus' sprite is glitched, but they act normal otherwise. Options are introduced to investigate various aspects of the shop, which Val foregos narrating; flavor text from Cyrus and Rudy is prompted instead. All backgrounds are glitched; Cyrus and Rudy seem to be aware something is off, but can't put their finger on why.
- Once all options are burned through, focus shifts to Val, who's been quiet. Cyrus and Rudy comment on her eye, which gets glitcher the more annoyed she becomes; in Val's narrative-thought, she's frustrated that they're picking up on it somehow, that *you* are still reading everything, and moreso that anyone is pretending to care.
- With apparently no prompting, bonus/day2 starts playing again, this time more like a cutscene (with uniquely-drawn graphics) than a sprite-dialogue scene. Dialogue is sporadically replaced with Val's frustration. The scene also continues past the "this is a game" reveal, where it cut off previously: Rudy returned from a nearby vending machine with a snack. When Val tried to ask about it, Kade interrupted to ask/tell her to go home.
- Back to the dorm; Val doesn't appear. Tomorrow she'll show you *everything*.

### day 8
- There's not much else to show.
- There are unused graphics that Val pieced together to suggest that, at some point, there was a scene in which Cyrus snapped and gave Rudy a black eye (of the bruise kind, not glitched). Val's not happy about it, either.
- That's it. Game closes/crashes and auto-deletes.
- In a text file left behind, Val apologizes. She has a few regrets.
