> Continued from [days 1–8]({%include url.html%}/bonus/meta-devnotes).

## day 9
- Kade wakes up from a nightmare, choking. Neck slit. Everywhere, empty.
- For the first time Kade sees the world as a literal lifeless expanse. Upon discovering the void at the edge of campus, he calls Val.
- Meeting up outside the shop, Kade finds Val smashing the vending machine. (It is indeed empty.) Kade is aware of everything up to day 3, maybe 4; Val claims they're not in a game *anymore*, as she can't access the files.
- Inside, Kade is startled by the glitchy wreckage, to which Cyrus and Rudy seem oblivious; they also don't recognize Val. (Kade briefly drags her out to insist she not give *them* existential crises too.) Additionally, Rudy has a black eye (source unknown), and is wearing Kade's beanie, which Kade didn't quite remember leaving at home.
- That evening, Val follows Kade back to the campus again, and awkwardly leaves at the doorway. Meanwhile, Rudy texts Cyrus to ask if they know what's troubling Kade. Cyrus is equally clueless, and the two commiserate over the headache-inducing deja vu they've had since the meetup.

## day 10
- Today Kade has an idea. Val finds him rounding up computer cords from around campus; since she won't leave, Kade enlists her help. Back at the void's edge, Kade secures one end of the cord-rope, and hands Val the rest: go see what's out there. It's the *least* she can do.
- Val doesn't return for a while. Kade finds her standing blankly at the end of the "rope;" she makes a vaguely-threatening commnent \["You think if someone died out here it'd make a sound?" or the like], and Kade immediately herds her back.
- At one point in the meeting, Rudy heads out for a snack break; Val follows, with Kade's encouragement. Simultaneously:
	- Rudy discovers the smashed vending machine; with Val acting off, he connects the dots. He says he won't tell on her, though, since he's familiar with frustration.
	- Kade confides in Cyrus about feeling off and hopeless lately, which sounds like a suicide attempt admission. Though Cyrus offers comfort, Kade can't stop staring at the ever-glitchy void wall.
- Night: Val follows Kade back again, to his annoyance. He discovers his laptop's been tampered with. \[There was... something more dramatic with this recurring dorm-scene-thing, I think, but forgot :T]

## day 11
- Weekend. Kade finally gets her laptop running and discovers an odd folder—the full script and assets of the game. Val calls, offering to help again; Kade tells her to go check out the city-void or something.
- Cyrus and Rudy are increasingly noticing the emptiness of their world. Evening: When Cyrus takes the bus loop, they find Val crashed onboard. From Cyrus' perspective, she's invasive as ever, asking backhanded questions about their motives, heavily implying they're a terrible person. From Val's perspective, she's practically begging for directions she can't get.
- Night: Kade, having reached the game's final day, gets a call from Cyrus. Val got off at the last stop and they're concerned about her. Kade leaves to pick her up but is really, *really* not feeling it.

## day 12–13
- Kade calls Cyrus and Rudy to an early meeting, laptop in tow. Val walks in on Kade showing them everything.
- Kade yells at Val for being fatalistic and dehumanizing everyone. Not *once* did she try to act against the game's script, nor did it ever seem to occur to her to use file-editing for good. Instead she complained and waved it all off, all to serve an impossible audience. The ranting quickly escalates; Kade only stops because Cyrus interjects. Rudy's crying.
- Val, who took everything in stunned silence, makes a feeble attempt at cheering Rudy up. This fails. She stands, apologizes simply, and leaves. Kade nearly follows, but Rudy sniffles; he wants to go home.
- Kade drives Rudy back as usual; deadly silent. Rudy scrawls up a note and leaves it on the seat, instructing Kade not to read it until returning to the dorm. After several lines of scribbled-out gibberish, it reads, "i dont want to be afraid of you."

&nbsp;

- Rudy vents to Cyrus over text, then leaves to play video games. Since he doesn't answer when Kade calls, Kade tries to find Valerie. Every single dorm is empty. But at the edge of the void, he finds a cord...
- Immediate, soul-crushing regret. There are two more reset files; he triggers the next, begging for another chance.
- Nothing seems to happen. Kade writes a note, then leaves to visit home.

&nbsp;

- Val wakes up. For the second time she is convinced she's not supposed to exist, and yet. There's a note under the door; although Kade regrets yelling at her, he's still mad, and has decided the two of them need a break from each other.
- Cyrus calls to check in; Val's a bit of a mess. After she apologizes for harassing them on the bus, she asks them how to be a good person.
- Meanwhile, Kade returns to Rudy and swears this won't happen again. Rudy, though hesitant, accepts.

## day 14
- Kade attempts to edit the files in hopes it'll alter the world, but results are negligible if existent at all. Rudy wants to try but is reckless. After hours of little progress, Rudy texts Cyrus: they need someone who knows how this works. Despite Cyrus' ethical qualms with Rudy's plan, they agree.
- Cyrus invites Kade to the arcade that night. Kade arrives, sees Val, and immediately u-turns. Ranting to the security camera, Kade insists they're not talking; Val leaves Rudy a message in parallel, echoing the sentiment. Both are convinced that the *other* party is more reluctant. However, Kade hesitates at the door.
- Kade finds Val on the open rooftop, and offers an in-person (if flippant) apology. When he asks Val to share her piece, Val monologues: she *hates* Kade. Hates that he's been using her from the getgo, hates that she didn't *care* if he did because she felt bad (and that he clearly knows this and took advantage; Kade can't argue), hates that "everyone" loves him— But more than anything, that letter *hurt*.
- Val tries to leave after that. Kade follows. The sky's hue shifts around (Rudy's unsupervized shenanigans, no doubt). Kade breaches the silence this time, thoroughly sobered. Despite everything, he still believes in second chances. He may not have forgiven Val, still—but he's willing to try. Which is more than enough for Val, despite herself.

## day 15–16
- The gang is finally (and very, very awkwardly) back together. Turns out Val doesn't know much about how the files work these days anyway.
- But after reassessing everything, it seems something fundamental about the world has changed with each reset: first, Val took over the game; second, the game ended and the world itself rebooted; third... whatever Kade did; and now there's one more.
- The answer, it seems, is obvious.
