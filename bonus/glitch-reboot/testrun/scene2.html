    <p class="comment">&lt;-- Context: Rudy just lost a game. Or YOU did, if you asked for his help. Can’t avoid it. Poor guy. :( --&gt;</p><p>R: UGH, really?!</p><p class="indent"><span class="code">[if chosen]</span>I swear that was a fluke, <span class="code">$joker</span>. It’ll go better next time.<span class="code">[/if]</span></p><p class="indent"><span class="code">[if not chosen]</span>That’s such b.s. I should’ve lasted at <i>least</i> another round.<span class="code">[/if]</span></p><p>V: Win some, lose some, Clubs.</p><p>R: And will you stop calling me <i>Club</i>? It’s like you only do that when you’re talking down to me.</p><p>V: Wow, really needed that spelled out!</p><p>K: GUYS.</p><p>R: Hey, I didn’t even wanna come here today!</p><p>K: Wait, really? What else would you be doing?</p><p class="joker">(Rudy crosses his arms.)</p><p>R: Lots.</p><p>V: Liiiike…?</p><p>R: <em>Stuff.</em></p><p class="joker">(Yeesh. It’s Val’s move, but she doesn’t seem interested in the game at all.)</p><p class="joker">(Kade looks nervously between all four of us, then smiles at Rudy.)</p><p>K: Are you still working on that castle?</p><p class="joker">(Rudy sits up, relaxing a little.)</p><p>R: First of all, it’s a <i>fortress</i>, and second, it’s a lot faster in multiplayer mode.</p><p>K: Aw, see? I’m glad it’s working out for you!</p><p class="joker">(Then, to me:)</p><p>K: He’s been making this HUGE cas-<em>fortress</em> in a virtual crafting game for months now. I totally gotta show you later—</p><p>V: So you <em>do</em> have friends outside here!</p><p class="joker">(Val leans forward, staring at Rudy with an expression I can’t read. Rudy’s back on defense.)</p><p>R: Uh, yeah? Is that a problem now, too?</p><p>V: What’re their names?</p><p>R: None of your business!</p><p>K: Oh, the server uses screennames! I don’t think anyone actually—</p><p>V: Can you tell me about them? Even fake names.</p><p>R: Geez! Why’s it so important everyone and their mother knows my entire friend group?</p><p>C: Having a support system is vital to anyone’s well-being.</p><p>V: What’s your mom’s name?</p><p class="joker">(She’s all eyes for Rudy.... His face is bright red and he looks ready to scream.)</p><p>K: OKAY, lesson learned, friends and getting along are important!</p><p>C: And so is not telling anyone, even your closest companions, the answer to common password security questions.</p><p class="joker">(I can’t tell if Cyrus is trying to defuse the situation or they’re actually that oblivious.)</p><p>R: FINE, you want names? My friends are Cyrus, <span class="code">$joker</span>… K-Kade…</p><p>K: Rudy, you don’t have to—</p><p>V: Aw, what, no love for me?</p><p class="joker">(Suddenly, Rudy stands up and slams the table.)</p><p>R: ME, MYSELF, AND I. THERE.</p><p class="joker">(Val sits back, unamused. Kade puts her head in her hands. Cyrus just looks surprised to have been called a friend.)</p><p class="joker">(Rudy glances around table, then gets up with a huff.)</p><p>R: I’m gonna grab a snack. Kade, yell for me when it’s time to go.</p><p>C: Er, wait, you still—</p><p class="joker">(The door slams shut behind Rudy.)</p><p>C: —had a move.</p><p class="joker">(I don’t think anyone feels like playing anymore.)</p><p class="joker">(After what feels like an eternity, Kade stands up too.)</p><p>K: Be right back. Val, can we talk for a sec?</p><p class="joker">(Without waiting for a response, she grabs Val by the arm and pulls her away. Val, not looking phased, flashes me a grin on the way out, like she wants me to know she expected this.)</p><p>C: Well, that was unexpected.</p>
