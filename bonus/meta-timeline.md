<b>2018-05-18</b>: Succumbed to the fanfic-writing void.

<b>2018-09-30</b>: First comprehensive outline of postgame fic. Consisted of 6 days and sendoff letters to the reader.

<b>2018-12-16</b>: Started entertaining the idea of an "original" offshoot, with a defined postgame goal of making a game—which doubles as filling out their world. By the end of the month this is becoming a full-fledged Thing™.

<b>2018-12-25</b>: Characters assigned card suit motifs based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card_suit#Metaphorical_uses" target="_blank" class="ext">hierarchy</a> and, to a lesser extent, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types" target="_blank" class="ext">Bartle taxonomy of player types</a>. The main character as "joker" and the game-within-a-game being card-based followed.

By the end of 2018, most if not all core game changes had been established, including character names and designs.

There's a lot of magic behind-the-scenes <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl" target="_blank" class="ext">Write The Rest Of The Fucking Story</a> stuff that goes on in 2019–2020. Some landmarks:

<b id="glitch">2019-01-16</b>: Coded a page test using the day2 bonus + <a href="glitch-reboot/testrun/scene2.html" target="_blank">context</a>.

<b>2019-03-06</b>: <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2019-03-06-songwall/" target="_blank" class="ext">songwall.html</a>

\[some point between <b>06-23</b> and <b>07-07</b>]: Initial concepts for the "bot arc."

<b>2019-07-14</b>: <a href="glitch-reboot/sibling-comix/1.html" target="_blank">Sibling comix saga</a>, the first.

<b>2019-07-18</b>: Sketch for the "menu" art.

<img src="{%include url.html%}/bonus/art/img/2019-07-18.png" alt=""/>

<b>2019-08-04</b>: hello-world repository gets <a href="https://github.com/a-flyleaf/hello-world/commit/fe2b6b6b542cbad1fa7e0cd2d08b3cd2bf40df4a" target="_blank" class="ext">overhauled</a>, with a placeholder icon.

<b>2019-08-13</b>: First sketches for the segment that will eventually become [debug]({%include url.html%}/2-debug).

It's hard to say what parts of the story came about when, at least without digging through hundreds of thousands of note-words, but approximating from [the sketch archive]({%include url.html%}/bonus/art) is a safe bet. I think most if not all major events had been defined by this point.

<b>2020-04-04</b>: Story <a href="https://github.com/a-flyleaf/hello-world/commit/12b810ffa7e842d2ae1d17937e32a96ea4cf2e24" target="_blank" class="ext">goes live</a>.

<b>2020-03-12</b>: Started/finished(?) spritework for [the display:block sequences]({%include url.html%}/2-debug/5).

<b>2020-04-11/12</b>: <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2020-04-1112-walkcycles/" target="_blank" class="ext">walkcycles.html</a>

<b>2021-04-04</b>: ["sibling comix"]({%include url.html%}/bonus/sibling-comix/1) debuts in the narrative proper.

By late 2020 development was slowing down, culminating in this:

<b>2021-12-22</b>: >claims I'm going to stop letting the story <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/project-rambling" target="_blank" class="ext">"haunt me"</a> >it immediately starts haunting me again

Major updates from here will be noted on [the blog]({%include url.html%}/blog).
