	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Win some, lose some, kiddo~</p>
	<p>R<span class="x">udy</span>: And will you stop calling me “kiddo”? For fuck’s sake, I’m almost in high school!</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: You look awful young to me!</p>
	<p>K<span class="x">ade</span>: GUYS.</p>

	<p>R<span class="x">udy</span>: It’s more fun than you losers.</p>
	<p>C<span class="x">yrus</span>: All right, I think it’s time to take a br—</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: What, isn’t all this conflict the most <em>amusing</em> thing ever?</p>
	<p><span class="x">narrator: </span><i>(It’s Val’s move, but she doesn’t seem interested in the game at all.)</i></p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Do you have a life outside here?</p>
	<p>K<span class="x">ade</span>: (Oh my fucking god...)</p>
	<p>R<span class="x">udy</span>: What’s THAT supposed to mean?</p>

	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Names? How you met? Anything?</p>
	<p>K<span class="x">ade</span>: Oh, the game uses screennames. I don’t think anyone actually—</p>
	<p>R<span class="x">udy</span>: Does it fucking matter?! Why’s it so important everyone and their mother knows my entire friend group?</p>
	<p>C<span class="x">yrus</span>: Having a support system is vital to anyone’s well-being.</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: What’s your mom’s name?</p>

	<p>K<span class="x">ade</span>: OKAY, lesson learned, friends and getting along are important!</p>
	<p>C<span class="x">yrus</span>: And so is not telling anyone, even your closest companions, the answer to common password security questions.</p>
	<p><i><span class="x">narrator: </span>(I can’t tell if Cyrus is trying to defuse the situation or if they’re actually that oblivious.)</i></p>

	<p><i><span class="x">narrator: </span>(Without waiting for a response, <span class="code">s/he</span> grabs Val by the arm and pulls her away. Val, unphased, flashes me a grin on the way out, like she wants me to know she expected this.)</i></p>
