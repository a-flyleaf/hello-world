Hi.

I know the ending was… abrupt.

Just rushed through a couple scenes
that didn’t make the cut, and then
closed the curtain. What a finale.

I guess some part of me hoped that
it wouldn’t matter if I showed it
out of context?

But does the fact I played it mean
it happened anyway? Who knows.

Isn’t that sad? No matter how much
I talked up everything being fake,
and how it only exists to give you
a good time…

I just couldn’t watch him cry.

It’s so… anticlimactic. All of it.

Days of buildup to a fun little game
group, and then Kade kills herself.
Days of buildup to a grand showcase
that… I can’t watch play out.





I shouldn’t have dragged you through this.

I think there was supposed to be a
big sendoff rant about how none of
this would have happened if you
just quit the game.

But that’s silly, isn’t it?
It’s nothing new.

I don’t blame you for anything.
You or anyone else.

So I guess, in the end, I just…

I hope this wasn’t a waste of time.
I hope you got something out of this.
Because in deconstructing everything, I…




I ruined
everything
that was ever real to me.

To us.








I’m sorry.
