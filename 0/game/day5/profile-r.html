	<div class="x">Image: A selection of concept art for Rudy’s character; he hasn’t changed much. The following description is typed on the image: “Kade’s little bro; snarky but means well. He kicks ass at video games and has countless ongoing stories in his head, but he’d never share any of them.”</div>
<div class="script">
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Well, here’s what he used to be like. Classic tagalong kid.</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Doesn’t seem like he’s changed much, huh? Which is weird, come to think of it, because Kade—</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Okay, you know how these two have a strict dad? Apparently Kade took the brunt of his anger growing up, higher expectations and all. So wouldn’t Rudy suffer like that now, too?</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Man, I hope he doesn’t. I kinda like the little guy.</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: But come <em>on</em>, growing up as a younger sibling versus an only child? That’s gotta fundamentally change a person.</p>
	<p>V<span class="x">al</span>: Maybe it’s another sign the game’s badly-written.</p>
