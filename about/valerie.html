<p>Hi! I’m Valerie (you can call me Val), resident gamewrecker. Trying to be less... game-wrecky this time around, though! I look like ^that, in the game sprites, and have also appeared like this:</p>
<img src="../0/game/day5/d5-s1.png" alt="Game screenshot. Val is in full color. V, excitedly: Ah well, never mind all that. Let’s see if anything else changed!"/>
<p>...and like this.</p>
<img src="../0/game/day8/d8-s1.gif" alt="Game screenshot. Val is drawn on, and her left (viewer’s right) eye is glitching out. Cyrus and Rudy’s sprites have been corrupted. Ambiguous speaker: It’s not important. Can we move on?!"/>
<p>Not my finest moment, that last one, but being secretive is <em>so</em> last week. Oh, and the concept art:</p>
<a href="../0/game/day5/profile-v"><img src="../0/game/day5/profile-v.png" alt="Concept art. A short description is visible but cropped off."/></a>
<p>Aaaand that’s it! That’s pretty much all there is to me.</p>
<p>You know, I’d really love to show you some other events from the past few days, but giant text walls are no fun. I’m sure the others will fill in the blanks ;)</p>
