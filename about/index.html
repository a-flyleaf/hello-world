<div class="x">Text in a void.</div>
<p>Hi there!</p><p>If you’re reading this, I guess something worked after all! See, we were <em>trying</em> to keep a record of our experiences and everything, but it looks like that got wiped out with the last reset. Long story short, we live in an artificial, incomplete world. And none of us know what to do about it!</p>
<div class="profiles"><div class="x"><p>The four are rendered in grayscale with one color, framed by a card suit shape: Val red spade, Kade blue heart, Cyrus yellow diamond, Rudy green club.</p><p>Hovering/selecting a profile renders the character in full color, and the shape behind them turns white. Their poses and expressions change as well: Val before talks to no one; Val after leans out of the spade, a finger by her mouth in a “shh.” Kade before slouches with a disgruntled frown; Kade after leans back, arms crossed with thumbs showing in defensive confidence, with an uneasy grin. Cyrus before holds their tie, looking blankly off to the side; Cyrus after smiles and offers the American Sign Language sign for “love.” Rudy before has his arms crossed defensively; Rudy after sticks his tongue out in a huge grin, both hands pointing at him with sideways peace signs. All four hover states are looking at the viewer.</p></div><a href="valerie"><div class="v"><img src="v.png" alt="Valerie"/></div></a><a href="kade"><div class="k"><img src="k.png" alt="Kade"/></div></a><a href="cyrus"><div class="c"><img src="c.png" alt="Cyrus"/></div></a><a href="rudy"><div class="r"><img src="r.png" alt="Rudy"/></div></a></div>
<p class="x">The ambiguous narrator continues.</p>
<p>For now, we’ve made new profiles that should suffice as a quick recap. And from here, we’ll <em>all</em> decide how the story goes.</p><p>I hope you’re entertained!</p><p>—V</p>
